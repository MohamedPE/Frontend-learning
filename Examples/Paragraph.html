    <h3>Poem</h3>
    <pre>
        In all chaotic beauty lies a wounded work of art.
        Beautiful but torn, wreaking havoc on my heart.
        Camouflaged by insecurities, blinded by it all.
        I love the way you sit there and barely notice me at all

      long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those
      who love, time is eternity.
